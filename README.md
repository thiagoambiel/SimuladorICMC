# Web Browser port of ICMC Processor Simulator

This repository hosts a browser version of ICMC Processor simulator for faster and easily use, without any local installation process.

- The simulator can be accessed through this [link](https://thiagoambiel.github.io/SimuladorICMC/).

## ICMC Processor

The [ICMC Processor](https://github.com/simoesusp/Processador-ICMC) is a simpler version of a common processor such as those used today by modern computers.
It was developed by the USP teacher [Eduardo do Valle Sim√µes](https://github.com/simoesusp) to help his students to understand, in a simpler and more intuitive way, how a processor really works.

## Demo Apps

You can find some demo apps to test the simulator in the `apps` directory.

The apps and games included in this repository are:

## Original Version

The [official repository](https://github.com/simoesusp/Processador-ICMC) brings much more info about the processor and how to coding to it, like:

- More apps and their sources
- Schemas explaining how the processor works
- A simpler CLI version for easier understanding
- An assembler to create new games from ASM code
- A compiler to create ASM code from C language code
- And more...
